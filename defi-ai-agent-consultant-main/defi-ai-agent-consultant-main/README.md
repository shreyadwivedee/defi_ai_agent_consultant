## Product Roadmap Overview

Our ultimate mission is to enable decentralized finance applications globally, starting in regions where crypto adoption is slowed by regulation or weak infrastructure. We follow a hybrid architecture that respects local compliance while offering Web3-native features through ICP's modular canister design and chain fusion capabilities. Currently, most users rely on CeFi applications due to their simplicity, fixed fees, and integrated tools. With our ICP-powered AI agent, users can manage their funds as smoothly as in CeFi—while benefiting from added DeFi wallet features and multi-chain access through chain fusion.

## 🌍 Focus Areas

We categorize our roadmap into two primary directions:

* **Local Market Features** – Tailored for emerging markets (e.g., Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon, and South Africa), where crypto is often viewed as a threat to fiat sovereignty. These features comply with local regulations and offer , regulated access to financial tools through ICP canisters.
* **Global Web3 Features** – A distinct track focused on DeFi-native tools such as on-chain credit, AMMs, DAOs, and yield aggregators, all powered by ICP's chain fusion technology.

## 🇪🇬 Local Market Features

### 💰 Regulated Coin Infrastructure

Our Regulated Coin system is a programmable fiat wrapper built on ICP canisters enabling seamless fiat inflows and outflows. We manage:

* Fiat custody via licensed partners through ICP HTTPS outcalls
* On-chain minting/burning via ICP canister functions
* Real-time KYC/AML compliance using ICP's secure computation
* Transaction approval through our ICP-based Rules Engine

### ⚙️ Dynamic Rules Engine

Each on-chain action is processed through modular ICP canisters in our Rules Engine featuring:

* **Stock Broker Canister** – Enforces investor registration and KYC
* **E-Commerce Canister** – Applies tax policies and regional restrictions
* **Banking Canister** – Implements AML checks powered by AI running on ICP and enforces withdrawal limits

### 🌟 Key Benefits

* Real-Time Settlement via ICP's fast finality
* DeFi-Like UX through ICP canisters
* Chain Fusion Interoperability across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains
* Regulatory Protection through ICP-based regulated custodians
* Compliant by Design via ICP's deterministic execution
* No Backend Ops Required with ICP's automatic scaling
* Custom Rules Per App Type through upgradeable canisters
* Full Regulated Coin Lifecycle Support via ICP smart contracts

## 📦 Funds Orderbook

Tokenized access to local investment funds via NFT certificates on ICP enables:
